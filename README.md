ðŸš€ WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING


ðŸ“ŒIntroduction

Water quality analysis plays a crucial role in assessing the suitability of water for various purposes, including drinking, agriculture, and industrial use. This project focuses on analyzing key water quality parameters such as Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC), pH level, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) using machine learning techniques. The analysis aims to understand the distribution of these parameters, their significance in assessing groundwater quality, and potential correlations between them.

ðŸ“ŒDataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis includes water quality measurements collected from various regions over multiple years. It contains information on parameters such as RSC, pH, TDS, geographical location, and classification of water quality. Preprocessing steps involve handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

ðŸ“ŒAnalysis of RSC

Summary:
Mean RSC value: [Mean value]
Mode RSC value: [Mode value]
Median RSC value: [Median value]
Significance: RSC values are crucial indicators of water alkalinity and its suitability for irrigation purposes. High RSC levels can indicate the presence of excess sodium carbonate, which may affect soil structure and crop growth.
Visualizations:
Histogram plot
District-wise distribution
Year-wise variation
Seasonal analysis

ðŸ“ŒAnalysis of pH

Summary:
Mean pH value: [Mean value]
Mode pH value: [Mode value]
Median pH value: [Median value]
Significance: pH levels determine the acidity or alkalinity of water, affecting its taste, corrosiveness, and ecological balance. Extreme pH values can indicate pollution or natural factors influencing water quality.
Visualizations:

District-wise distribution
Year-wise variation
Seasonal analysis

ðŸ“ŒAnalysis of TDS
Summary:
Mean TDS value: [Mean value]
Mode TDS value: [Mode value]
Median TDS value: [Median value]
Significance: TDS levels reflect the concentration of dissolved solids in water, including salts, minerals, and organic compounds. High TDS levels may indicate water salinity and affect its taste, suitability for consumption, and impact on aquatic ecosystems.

Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations for water resource management and public health interventions based on the analysis findings.

ðŸ“ŒMachine Learning Approach (if applicable)
Algorithms Considered: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Feature Selection: Exclude irrelevant features such as geographical coordinates, village, and season.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy scores for model evaluation on test datasets.

ðŸ“ŒConclusion
The analysis of water quality parameters using machine learning techniques provides valuable insights into the state of groundwater quality and its implications for various stakeholders. By understanding the distribution, trends, and correlations between key parameters, informed decisions can be made to improve water resource management practices and safeguard public health.

ðŸ“ŒFuture Work
Incorporating Additional Data: Explore the integration of additional data sources such as meteorological data, land use patterns, and groundwater recharge rates for more comprehensive analysis.
