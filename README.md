ðŸš€ WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING


ðŸ“ŒIntroduction

Water quality analysis plays a crucial role in assessing the suitability of water for various purposes, including drinking, agriculture, and industrial use. This project focuses on analyzing key water quality parameters such as Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC), pH level, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) using machine learning techniques. The analysis aims to understand the distribution of these parameters, their significance in assessing groundwater quality, and potential correlations between them.

ðŸ“ŒDataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis includes water quality measurements collected from various regions over multiple years. It contains information on parameters such as RSC, pH, TDS, geographical location, and classification of water quality. Preprocessing steps involve handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

ðŸ“ŒAnalysis of RSC

Summary:
Mean RSC value: -2.36
Mode RSC value: -0.60
Median RSC value: -1.36
Significance: RSC values are crucial indicators of water alkalinity and its suitability for irrigation purposes. High RSC levels can indicate the presence of excess sodium carbonate, which may affect soil structure and crop growth.

ðŸ“ŒAnalysis of pH

Summary:
Mean pH value: 7.84
Mode pH value: 7.98
Median pH value: 7.86
Significance: pH levels determine the acidity or alkalinity of water, affecting its taste, corrosiveness, and ecological balance. Extreme pH values can indicate pollution or natural factors influencing water quality.

ðŸ“ŒAnalysis of TDS
Summary:
Mean TDS value: 859.38
Mode TDS value: 659.2
Median TDS value: 746.56
Significance: TDS levels reflect the concentration of dissolved solids in water, including salts, minerals, and organic compounds. High TDS levels may indicate water salinity and affect its taste, suitability for consumption, and impact on aquatic ecosystems.
